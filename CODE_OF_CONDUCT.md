# Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be respectful, be constructive, and remember there's a human on the other side of the screen.

## The Longer Version

This is primarily a solo project, but contributions are welcome. Here's what I expect:

### When Participating

**Do:**
- Be kind and patient with others
- Give constructive feedback
- Accept that people have different skill levels and perspectives
- Focus on what's best for the project
- Show empathy toward other community members

**Don't:**
- Use offensive language or personal attacks
- Troll, insult, or make derogatory comments
- Harass anyone publicly or privately
- Share others' private information without permission
- Act in ways that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

### Scope

This applies to:
- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Code reviews
- Community discussions
- Any other project communication

### Enforcement

If someone's behavior is problematic, I'll:
1. Usually start with a friendly reminder
2. If it continues, issue a warning
3. For serious or repeated violations, block from the project

I'm not interested in being the Code of Conduct police, but I also won't tolerate harassment or abuse.

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, email me at jonmartin721@gmail.com. I'll review and respond as quickly as possible.

## Attribution

Inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), but adapted to fit this project's scale and style.

## Questions?

If you're not sure whether something is appropriate, err on the side of being respectful. When in doubt, just ask.
